# Design System

A design system is a set of guidelines that helps you create a consistent look and feel across your app. It includes elements like colors, fonts, and other design components. Using a design system ensures that your app’s interface is visually cohesive, easy to use, and aligned with your brand.

## Color Scheme

The color scheme sets the colors for your app’s design, making sure everything looks consistent and visually appealing. It helps create a memorable user experience and reinforces your brand’s identity.

### Understanding Color Scheme

To design an appealing theme easily, it's important to understand our Color Scheme system. This system simplifies creating a cohesive and attractive theme without added complexity.

Inspired by [Material3 guidelines](https://m3.material.io/), we focus on a carefully chosen selection of essential colors rather than the entire palette. This approach ensures high-quality design while balancing customizability with simplicity, making it easier to manage your theme.

The color scheme is organized into two main sections:

#### Brand Colors

- **Primary**: The dominant color used for main UI elements like buttons and app bars, defining the app’s overall look.

- **On Primary**: The color used for text and icons on the primary color background, ensuring they are readable and stand out.

- **Secondary**: An accent color for secondary elements and actions, such as indicators and highlights, that complement the primary color.

- **On Secondary**: The color used for text and icons on the secondary color background, providing clear contrast for legibility.

#### Base Colors (Light & Dark Mode)

- **Background**: The primary color for the app’s background, providing a foundation for the rest of the UI.

- **On Background**: The color used for text and icons on the background, ensuring they are readable and stand out.

- **Surface**: The color for surfaces such as cards and modals, making them distinct from the background.

- **On Surface**: The color for text and icons on surface elements, ensuring clarity and visibility.

- **Surface Variant**: A secondary surface color used for elements like cards or sections, offering subtle contrast from the primary surface color.

- **On Surface Variant**: The color used for text and icons on the surface variant, maintaining readability and contrast.

- **Outline**: The color used for outlines on elements like buttons, providing definition and focus.

- **Outline Variant**: The color used for dividers and borders, offering subtle separation and visual distinction.

### Customizing Color Scheme

You can customize the color scheme to match your app’s branding and design preferences. To do so:

1. Navigate to Theme **Theme Settings** > **Color Scheme**.

2. Select and adjust the color for each item based on your design needs.

This allows you to tailor the color scheme to better fit your app’s visual style and user experience requirements.
