# Design System

A design system is a set of guidelines that ensures a consistent look and feel across your app. It includes elements like colors, fonts, and other design components, helping to create an interface that is visually cohesive, user-friendly, and aligned with your brand.

## Color System

Our Color System is designed to make theme creation straightforward. Drawing inspiration from the [Material3](https://m3.material.io/) guidelines. We've carefully selected a core set of colors that balance customizability with ease of use. From this foundation, we derive additional colors while adhering to the guidelines. This approach keeps your app’s design consistent, visually appealing, and easy to manage without adding unnecessary complexity.

### Understanding Color System

This Color System is your guide to applying colors meaningfully across your UI. It’s structured around two key areas: Brand Colors, which represent your brand identity, and Base Colors, which establish the foundational elements of your app's design, like background, surface, and outlines.

#### Brand Colors

- **Primary**: The central color used for prominent UI elements, such as buttons and app bars, establishing the primary tone of your app.

- **On Primary**: The color applied to text and icons that sit on the primary color background, ensuring legibility and contrast.

- **Secondary**: A complementary accent color for secondary elements, including indicators and highlights, that enhances the primary color.

- **On Secondary**: The color used for text and icons on the secondary color background, providing clear visibility and contrast.

#### Base Colors

- **Background**: The foundational color for your app’s background, serving as a neutral base that supports the rest of the UI.

- **On Background**: The color for text and icons displayed on the background, designed to be clear and visible.

- **Surface**: The color for surface elements like cards and modals, helping them stand out from the background.

- **On Surface**: The color applied to text and icons on surface elements, ensuring they are readable and distinct.

- **Surface Variant**: A secondary surface color that provides subtle differentiation for various sections within your app.

- **On Surface Variant**: The color for text and icons on the surface variant, maintaining readability and contrast.

- **Outline**: The color used for outlines around elements like buttons, which adds definition and focus.

- **Outline Variant**: The color for dividers and borders, creating clear separations within your UI.

### Customizing Colors

You can customize the color scheme to match your app’s branding and design preferences. To do so:

1. Navigate to Theme **Theme Settings** > **Color Scheme**.

2. Select and adjust the color for each item according to your design needs.

This customization allows you to tailor the color scheme to fit your app’s unique style and user experience.

## Typography

Typography defines the text styles used throughout your app, ensuring consistency and readability. It plays a key role in shaping the overall user experience and reinforcing your brand’s identity.

Our Typography system is divided into two key categories:

- **Primary Font**: Applied to major elements like headings and titles, giving your app a distinct and organized look.

- **Secondary Font**: Used for smaller text like descriptions and captions, complementing the primary font for a balanced design.

### Customizing Typography

To customize your typography:

1. Navigate to **Theme Settings** > **Typography**.

2. Select your primary and secondary fonts to fit your app’s style.
