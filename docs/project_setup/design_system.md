# Design System

A design system is a set of guidelines that ensures a consistent look and feel across your app. It includes elements like colors, fonts, and other design components, helping to create an interface that is visually cohesive, user-friendly, and aligned with your brand.

Both the Color Scheme and Typography are part of the instant feature, allowing dynamic updates in real time without the need for a full app rebuild.

## Color Scheme

The color scheme defines the colors used throughout your app’s design, ensuring consistency and visual appeal. A well-chosen color scheme enhances the user experience and strengthens your brand identity.

### Understanding Color System

Our Color System is designed to make theme creation straightforward. Drawing inspiration from the [Material3 guidelines](https://m3.material.io/) guidelines, we’ve selected a core set of colors that provide a balance between customizability and ease of use. This approach ensures your app’s design is both consistent and visually appealing, with easy theme management.

The color scheme is organized into two main sections:

#### Brand Colors

- **Primary**: The main color used for key UI elements like buttons and app bars, setting the overall tone of your app.

- **On Primary**: The color for text and icons placed on the primary color background, ensuring they are readable and stand out.

- **Secondary**: An accent color for secondary elements like indicators and highlights, complementing the primary color.

- **On Secondary**: The color for text and icons on the secondary color background, providing clear contrast and legibility.

#### Base Colors (Light & Dark Mode)

- **Background**: The primary color for the app’s background, providing a neutral foundation for the rest of the UI.

- **On Background**: The color used for text and icons on the background, ensuring clarity and visibility.

- **Surface**: The color for surface elements like cards and modals, differentiating them from the background.

- **On Surface**: The color for text and icons on surface elements, ensuring they remain clear and legible.

- **Surface Variant**: A secondary surface color offering subtle contrast for different sections within the app.

- **On Surface Variant**: The color for text and icons on the surface variant, maintaining readability and contrast.

- **Outline**: The color used for outlines, such as those on buttons, providing structure and focus.

- **Outline Variant**: The color for dividers and borders, creating subtle separations within the UI.

### Customizing Colors

You can customize the color scheme to match your app’s branding and design preferences. To do so:

1. Navigate to Theme **Theme Settings** > **Color Scheme**.

2. Select and adjust the color for each item according to your design needs.

This customization allows you to tailor the color scheme to fit your app’s unique style and user experience.

## Typography

Typography defines the text styles used throughout your app, ensuring consistency and readability. It plays a key role in shaping the overall user experience and reinforcing your brand’s identity.

### Understanding Typography System

Our Typography system is divided into two key categories:

- **Primary Font**: Applied to major elements like headings and titles, giving your app a distinct and organized look.

- **Secondary Font**: Used for smaller text like descriptions and captions, complementing the primary font for a balanced design.

### Customizing Typography

To customize your typography:

1. Navigate to **Theme Settings** > **Typography**.

2. Select your primary and secondary fonts to fit your app’s style.
